refactor(bedrock): Restrict AWS authentication to explicit keys or roles

This commit refactors the Amazon Bedrock provider to no longer load credentials from `~/.aws/` shared configuration profiles. Authentication is now limited to:

- Explicit `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` provided in the `llm-cli` profile.
- AWS SDK's default credential chain (environment variables, IAM roles, etc.) when explicit keys are not provided.

Changes include:
- `internal/config/config.go`: Removed `AWSProfileName` field from `Profile` struct.
- `cmd/set.go`: Removed `aws_profile_name` setting logic.
- `internal/llm/bedrock.go`: Modified `newBedrockClient` to remove `config.WithSharedConfigProfile` and prioritize static credentials.
