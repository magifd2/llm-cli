# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]

### ‚ú® Features
*   **Google Cloud Vertex AI Provider Support**: Added support for interacting with Google Cloud Vertex AI.
*   **Enhanced `profile add` Command**: The `profile add` command now allows specifying parameters such as provider, model, endpoint, API key, AWS credentials, GCP Project ID, location, and credentials file path in a single command.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor
*   **Vertex AI SDK Migration**: Migrated to the latest `google.golang.org/genai` SDK, including fixes for service account authentication, correct `Client` object usage, and proper streaming iterator handling.
*   **Runtime Expansion of Credential File Paths**: Changed the expansion of `credentials_file` paths to occur at runtime instead of at configuration time, providing greater flexibility in dynamic home directory environments.

### üìù Documentation
*   **Updated Related Documentation**: `README.ja.md` and `README.en.md` have been updated to reflect the addition of the Vertex AI provider and the enhanced `profile add` command.
*   **Revised Provider Development Guide**: Removed specific provider implementation details from `DEVELOPING_PROVIDERS.ja.md` and `DEVELOPING_PROVIDERS.en.md`.
*   **Updated Changelogs**: `CHANGELOG.ja.md` and `CHANGELOG.en.md` have been updated.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor
*   **Code Audit and Quality Improvements**: Performed a full code audit and fixed potential bugs and vulnerabilities. Hardened against command injection in `profile edit`, centralized config path management, and improved error messages to enhance robustness and maintainability.

## v0.0.4 - 2025-08-01

### üêõ Bug Fixes
*   **API Error Handling**: Fixed an issue where API errors during streaming mode were not detected, causing the program to exit silently. Resolved a race condition in asynchronous handling to make error reporting more robust.

## v0.0.3 - 2025-08-01

### üö® Breaking Changes
*   **Command Name and Flag Changes**: The `ask` command has been renamed to `prompt`. The `--prompt` flag has been renamed to `--user-prompt`, and `--prompt-file` has been renamed to `--user-prompt-file`. Existing scripts and workflows will need to be updated.

### ‚ú® Features
*   **Command Name and Flag Refactoring**: Renamed the `ask` command to `prompt` and the `--prompt` flag to `--user-prompt`. Added shorthand flags for `--user-prompt` (`-p`), `--system-prompt` (`-P`), `--user-prompt-file` (`-f`), and `--system-prompt-file` (`-F`).

### üìù Documentation
*   **Added Development Log and Plan**: `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` were added to record project history and future plans.
*   **Updated Development Rules**: `GEMINI.md` was updated with new development rules (e.g., absolute paths for file operations, root cause bug fixes, documentation updates, pre-commit commits, code quality and security, comment principles).

## v0.0.2 - 2025-08-01

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Amazon Bedrock Nova Model Support**: Added support for interacting with Nova models such as `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor

*   **Bedrock Provider Refactoring**: The internal implementation of the Bedrock provider has been redesigned to strictly conform to the Nova model's Messages API specification.
    *   Updated request/response structs (`novaMessageContent`, `novaMessage`, `novaSystemPrompt`, `novaMessagesAPIRequest`, `novaCombinedAPIResponse`, `novaMessagesAPIStreamChunk`).
    *   Adjusted prompt and inference parameter handling to align with the Nova API.
    *   Fixed streaming response parsing logic.
*   **Improved Provider Selection Logic**: Modified `cmd/ask.go` to dynamically select `NovaBedrockProvider` based on the model ID prefix (`amazon.nova`) when the `bedrock` provider is chosen.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   **Prompt Validation Fix**: Centralized prompt validation in `cmd/ask.go` and removed redundant validation from `internal/llm/bedrock_nova.go`. This makes a prompt from `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or standard input mandatory.

### üìù Documentation

*   **Documentation Updates**: Updated `README.md` and `BUILD.md` to reflect the new Bedrock setup procedures and build process changes.
*   **Makefile Improvements**: Corrected the `make all` command to also perform cross-compilation and organized the build output directory.

## v0.0.1 - 2025-07-31

### ‚ú® Features

*   **LLM Interaction Functionality**:
    *   Supports interaction with Ollama and LM Studio (OpenAI-compatible API).
    *   Supports prompt input from command-line arguments, files, and standard input.
    *   Supports streaming response display (`--stream` flag).
*   **Profile Management Functionality**:
    *   Manages multiple LLM configurations as profiles (`profile list`, `profile use`, `profile add`, `profile set`, `profile remove`, `profile edit`).
*   **Build System**:
    *   Initialized Go modules and introduced the Cobra CLI framework.
    *   Supports build, test, and cross-compilation (macOS Universal, Linux, Windows) via `Makefile`.
    *   Organizes build artifacts into platform-specific directories.

### üìù Documentation

*   Created `README.md` and added feature descriptions.
*   Created `BUILD.md` and detailed build procedures.
*   Explicitly stated Gemini development support and MIT License in `README.md`.
*   Reflected improvements suggested in code reviews in `BUILD.md` and `README.md`.
