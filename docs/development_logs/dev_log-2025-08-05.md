## 2025-08-05 (Fix: Incorrect Versioning and Release Process Improvement)

- **Problem**: The released binary showed an incorrect version (`v0.0.10-alpha` or `v0.0.9`) instead of the intended `v0.0.10`. This was caused by two separate issues:
    1.  **Hardcoded Version**: The version string was initially hardcoded in `cmd/root.go`.
    2.  **Incorrect Git Tag Association**: After amending a commit, the `v0.0.10` Git tag was not moved to the new commit, causing the build system to pick up the previous version tag (`v0.0.9`).
- **Solution**:
    1.  **Dynamic Versioning**: Modified `cmd/root.go` to use a variable for the version string. Updated the `Makefile` to dynamically inject the latest Git tag into this variable at build time using `-ldflags`.
    2.  **Corrected Git Tag**: The incorrect `v0.0.10` tag was deleted locally and remotely, then re-tagged on the correct commit and pushed again.
- **Process Improvement**: To prevent future release errors, created a new `RELEASING.md` document.
    - This document provides a clear, step-by-step checklist for creating a new release.
    - It includes a safer verification step that checks the version of the binary directly from the build directory, avoiding the need to install it and potentially affect the user's system.
- **Outcome**: The build process now correctly embeds the Git tag version into the binary. The new `RELEASING.md` guide will help ensure future releases are smooth and error-free.

## 2025-08-05 (Maintenance: Go Module Updates and Release)

- **Objective**: To ensure the project's dependencies are up-to-date and to perform a new release.
- **Actions**:
    - **Dependency Check**: Ran `go list -u -m all` to identify outdated Go modules.
    - **Vulnerability Scan**: Executed `make vulncheck` to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced with the updates. No vulnerabilities were found.
    - **Module Update**: Ran `go get -u ./...` to update all dependencies to their latest versions.
    - **Tidy Modules**: Ran `go mod tidy` to clean up the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.
    - **Build Verification**: Performed a full build using `make all` to ensure the updated modules did not introduce any breaking changes.
- **Release**:
    - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.ja.md` with the dependency update information.
    - Committed the changes with the message "feat: Update Go modules and bump version to v0.0.10".
    - Created and pushed the Git tag `v0.0.10`.
