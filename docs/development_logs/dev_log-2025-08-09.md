### Reviewer Feedback Addressing

Addressed feedback from the reviewer regarding code set status:

1.  **Setting Key Consistency**: Standardized the display of available keys in the `llm-cli profile set` command's error messages and help output to use hyphenated names (e.g., `api-key` instead of `api_key`). This was done without breaking backward compatibility for existing `config.json` files or user input.
2.  **`go.mod` Dependencies**: Executed `go mod tidy` to clean up unused dependencies and ensure `go.mod` and `go.sum` are up-to-date.
3.  **Documentation Consistency**: Expanded `RELEASING.md` to include a comprehensive checklist for updating all relevant documentation during a release. Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to refer to `RELEASING.md` for detailed documentation guidelines.

### Codebase Refactoring (Detected during review)

Observed and incorporated changes from a significant refactoring of the `internal/llm` package, which involved separating each provider into its own sub-package and introducing `NewProvider` factory functions. This improves modularity and testability.

### Verification

Performed comprehensive build tests (`make build`, `make lint`, `make test`, `make vulncheck`) to ensure no regressions were introduced and code quality was maintained. All tests passed successfully.
