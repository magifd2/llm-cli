	Short: "A CLI tool for interacting with various LLM providers.",
	Long: `llm-cli is a powerful command-line interface tool designed for seamless interaction with various Large Language Model (LLM) providers.
It supports providers such as Ollama, LM Studio (OpenAI compatible API), Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI.

Key Features:
- Interact with multiple LLM providers from your terminal.
- Manage different LLM configurations using profiles, allowing for easy switching between models and settings.
- Send prompts via command-line arguments, files, or standard input.
- Receive streaming responses for real-time interaction.

This tool simplifies the process of experimenting with and utilizing different LLMs directly from your command line.`,

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
